# Powershell4all
The idea of this project is an open collaboration between skilled Powershell professionals, who are integrating the usual daily tasks of a Microsoft System Administrator into functions.

The Powershell4All project is divided into modules, which contain functions for one specific area.

At the moment we have only one module published, but many are on the way.

Functions are here to serve their user(admin) with the ease of administration.

This collaboration project is open, anyone who is willing to contribute is very WELCOME, please fork our project and submit a pull request.

Since the contributors are also busy with day-to-day activities, we can not say how often we will update the project, but we will give our best!

We are hosting the main project on the GitHub link: https://github.com/nemanja-jovic/powershell4all

The module(s) are still in an early and fresh stage, we are planning to add many functionalities related to many Microsoft technologies.

If you notice any bugs or you have any advice for improvements, please CONTRIBUTE!
